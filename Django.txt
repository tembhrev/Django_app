How web works
-------------
You start off by typing the URL into your browser.

Your computer then sends this request as a packet, which includes the IP address of the website you want.

It sends this request through wires, or a satellite which eventually links to wires using your ISP.

Your ISP will then re-route the request to the appropriate server location, using the IP address as the guide.

Once your request reaches the server, it can  send back the website you asked for.

However a full website with content is too big to send as a single packet of data.

To solve this, the server sends back the website split up into many packets.

The packets come with instructions on how to get back to you and reassemble once they reach you.

The packets don’t care how they get to you, just the final location.

Once the packets reach you, they are reassembled to show the page.

All of this moves at close to the speed of light, so it happens very fast.

There are two main components of a website
The Front-End
The Back-End

The Front-End is what you see as a user on the website. 
The Back-End is the technology used to actually decide what to show you on the Front-End.

The Front-End revolves around three technologies:
HTML
CSS
Javascript

Front-End technologies such as jQuery and Bootstrap, but those are all built using the previous three.

HTML - HyperText Markup language
Every website will have HTML, it is the structure of a page.
You can view it by right-clicking and selecting “View Page Source”

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
CSS is the actual styling of the website.
Colors, fonts, borders, etc is all defined by CSS.
CSS is not mandatory, but almost all sites have it.

Javascript allows you to add interactivity to the website, including programming logic.
Any site with interactivity uses Javascript in some way, otherwise the site is “static”.

The Back-End of a site has three components:
The Language
The Framework
The Database

Our course Back-End uses:
Python as the language
Django as the Framework
SQLite as the Database

technologies such as CSS to style the HTML and Javascript to add functionality.

HTML Basics
Tagging
Lists
Divs and Spans
Attributes

<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h6></h6>

<p></p>
<i></i> or <em></em>
<b></b> or <strong></strong>

Let’s get all our information on our HTML page organized!
One way to do this is with a list.
HTML has two types of lists: ordered and unordered.
We can then add list elements to each!

<ol></ol>
<li></li>
<ul></ul>

Divs and Spans -used to group blocks of HTML

<div class="groupone">
      <h1>Group One</h1>
      <p>want to be together in group one</p>
</div>

<div class="groupone">
      <h1>Group One</h1>
      <p>want to be <span>together in</span>group one</p>
</div>

Attributes:

HTML Attributes allow us to add more information to HTML tags
This includes things such as adding a link or referencing an image

<img src="view.png" alt="oh! Image not found">
img is self closing tag

<a href="https://www.google.com">Click Me</a>
